# No Man's Land (Workling Title)

* **Be thorough, but don't be absolute.** ```Remember that everything must be allowed to change and evolve over the course of the project, and the design document is a general description more than a blueprint. If you end up with a totally different game to the one that you laid out in the design document, as long as it's better it doesn't really matter. ```
* **Don't be hesitant to name check other games;** ```it's often the best way to get across a point to yourself/your team members. That said, don't make that all your document is. ("The wit of Grim Fandango meets COD4-quality FPS meets LBP user-creation" sounds great, but doesn't explain what you're doing or how you're going to do it.)```
* **Write well.** ```Just because this is for your team's personal use doesn't mean that you shouldn't try to make it as readable and expressive as possible - remember, this is the document that you'll be looking back on during development to try to recapture the feelings and ideas you had about the project in the first place. ```


## Intro
The future is here in Mongolia, and the future is nomadic. With the assistance of advanced robotics, the most grueling of tasks in a pastoral life are automated, and much of the Mongolian people live as nomads of the future, permanently wandering through its open expanses. With communications tech that spans the whole country and high-tech homes that guarantee a traditional yet modern standard of living, these new nomadic Mongolians continue to participate in and reap the benefits of the global economy.
The engineer works on his blueprints next to the shimmering Selenge River, the programmer makes his software in the midst of the Dornod grasslands, the musician livestreams his performance in front of the Otgontenger Mountain; all happening as robotic assistants take care of the pastoral herd that make up their subsistence.
But not everyone here gets to live the mythology of 22nd century nomadism. The cities are depopulated and abandoned, mostly functioning as live-in factories for essential goods. As only the working poor were left to work in the cities, the urban areas have become impoverished, ruined and desolate, a blight upon a country famous for its scenery. You’re an elch, a local law enforcer sent to investigate the factory town of Bulagt that has recently lost communication with the rest of the country.
Once a city of 100,000 people, Bulagt is now almost a ghost town with only its copper mines and foodstuff factories still operating with a population that barely reaches 10,000. It is unclear what happened there, it may have been a power outage, an uprising, or something far, far worse. No Man’s Land is a sci-fi top-down adventure game taking place in an urban marriage of both post-socialist and post-capitalist decay.

# :performing_arts: Characters 
## Main characters
* **Soronzonbold - Protagonist**. An elch who has been working at an örtöö (checkpoint in Mongolian) for the last 4 years, expecting to earn enough money to buy his own resources to become a nomad. Initially suspicious of the locals of Bulagt, Soronzonbold begins to change his view of them as he notices the class system that has kept the factory workers of Bulagt stuck in their living condition for decades.
* **Margad – Deuteragonist**. A young teenage girl that lives in Bulagt as the leader of the Union of Bulagt Filmmakers, a group of Bulagt children aspiring to create film in an impoverished town where none of the resources are available. Famous for the stacks of notebooks that she uses to write down ideas before she forgets them, Margad’s Union of Bulagt Filmmakers are locally known for their stage plays, where the children who have written screenplays, but has none of the filming equipment would act out their films in front of an audience.
* **Enkhjin – Antagonist**. Initially presented as a mysterious leader of the Bulagt uprising plotting to use the town as a base for greater insurrection. Later shown to be someone protesting the Great Switch, a phenomenon where the well-off urban population of Mongolia began to leave cities in favor of the mythologized lifestyle of futuristic pastoralism. With their technological advantage, the new nomads began to suffocate the livelihood of traditional nomadic Mongolians, who were driven to live in the decaying cities for their traditional lifestyle was taken over by the so-called “nomads of the 22nd century”.

# :clapper: Rough Plot (TBD) 
4-6 paragraphs. With as little backstory as possible, describe the game from start to finish. Include a rough breakdown of what is cutscene, what is gameplay, etc. With each part of the plot, it should be obvious how it will be presented in the game itself.

# :bulb: Concept & Reference 
## Artistic Style Outline
The setting is a ghost town full of blocky and brutalist buildings like drenched in the grey aura of stagnation all too common in the dwellings of post-socialist countries. But those buildings would be covered in corporate ads, billboards and product placement murals, as if this city was embarrassed of their socialist origin, and wanted to cover up socialist monochromatism with as much capitalist color as possible. As the city became depopulated, the grey blocks and the colorful ads would both be neglected, their mutual decay merging into a singular symbol of all-encompassing destitution that transcended any ideological aesthetic. A decay that symbolized neither the promises of socialism, nor that of capitalism were able to give nomadic Mongolia the fruits of development; and both were left to gather dust in the heaps of history. The images below was taken as reference, but imagine it a hundred times more dilapidated:

## Ideas

### Mail Tower
Mail towers are arguably the only modern buildings that can be found within Mongolia’s factory towns. A town could be in complete ruins where most of its inhabitants live in destitution, but the town’s Mail Tower will always be well-kept and in good condition. The goods and products of the factory town are stored in the Mail Towers, where delivery drones across the country arrive to pick them up and deliver them onto nomadic citizens that ordered them online. As the most fundamental vein of Mongolia’s non-nomadic economy, the Mail Towers are highly protected by the government. One of Enkhjin’s plans involved using the Bulagt Mail Tower to distribute goods rigged with bombs.

### Örtöö
Small relay stations spread around the country and operated by government workers, the örtöö serves as a base of law enforcement, government contact center and a Wi-Fi provider for the people of the steppes. Most örtöös exist 40-80 kms apart from each other, and are usually operated by 4-8 people, known as elch. Our main character Soronzonbold is one of the aforementioned elch, and as he investigates the desolate city of Bulagt, his fellow elch will provide him with information and assistance from their örtöö home base.

### Dankhar
The most fundamental piece of technology that allowed the people of Mongolia to pursue a nomadic life in the 22nd century, dankhars (combination of dankh and bankhar) are a variety of robots meant to fulfill purposes such as herding cattle, protecting them from carnivorous wildlife, detecting appropriate pastures to prevent overgrazing, and meat preparation/butchery. With the struggles of pastoral life made easier through the Dankhars, most nomads get to pursue their own careers and hobbies the same way they could back in the urban cities.

### Career Tribes
Despite the extremely spread-out nature of nomadic Mongolians, most of them are loosely organized into tribes based on their profession (Engineering tribe, craftsmen tribe, programming tribe, etc.). A free association of those united in their career prospects, tribe members usually travel together while still living in significant distances from each other. Meeting up every few months to democratically reach decision-making in issues such as relocation, tribe budget spending, or the admittance and professional tutelage of new members.

### Expat Nomads
Expat Nomads are members of the tribe that work online in companies or organizations across the world, and thus have to coordinate their sleep cycle to the timezone of their employer organization. Famously includes those employed by companies from the U.S. East Coast, which has a precisely 12-hour timezone gap with Mongolia, effectively making these nomads nocturnal. By nature of working in international enterprises, the expat nomads earn far more money compared to their fellow tribesmen and are able to budgetarily contribute to the tribe far greater, and thus are usually accompanied by assistant roommates that can take care of the actual day-to-day businesses while the expat nomads get some rest.

### Union of Bulagt Filmmakers
A group of Bulagt teenagers aspiring to become filmmakers despite having pretty much no access to any filmmaking resources. Often writing down ideas on any notebook or paper they can salvage from the town, the kids come together to act out each other’s screenplays in forms of impromptu plays. The films they imagine in their head will only get to exist at that very moment. The living conditions of the town have pretty much guaranteed that these kids have no real way out of their destitution into becoming actual filmmakers. And the town’s adults don’t see much value in their plays, preferring to have the kids continue to work in factories instead.

# :triangular_ruler: Game Flow Diagram
The intent of this section is to lay out, step by step, what the player experiences from as soon as they turn on the game until the end. While this can be generic and use a lot of loops (ie. Start Game -> Cutscene -> Tutorial -> loop(Cutscene -> Level -> Results Screen) -> End), it's probably a good idea to attempt to envisage how your game might be able to break up the monotony that is evident in that design.
The great thing about this section is it gets you really thinking about what your game is and how it is presented, as opposed to the amalgam of disjointed ideas in your head. The deeper you get into this Game Flow Diagram, the more confident you will be about what your game is precisely made up of, and what the experience of playing it will be.

# :clipboard: Additional Ideas and Possibilities 
This final section is a bit of an amalgam of everything that didn't fit in the sections before hand. It's an appendix of all of the things that you didn't think were necessarily core to the game, but you'd like to consider along the way. It's also for alternate possibilities - for instance, if you had two main characters in mind, put the better one in the main document, and then the alternate here. Finally, if you have any ideas that you're not sure about, but would like to prototype, then this is the place for that stuff as well.
